# XL Armors for Bright Night
Version for vanilla, with explanations [here](https://github.com/leoCottret/cbn-leocottret-mods/edit/main/MODS/XL_ARMORS_BRIGHT_NIGHT/README.md)    
This is the version for Kenan's modpack (well, with vanilla too, I just put everything generated here).  
I was particularly interested by the "More Survivor Stuff" version, maybe you would be too.  
I didn't test everything, this was generated with a script, use it at your risk or be ready to fix a few things, just in case.
