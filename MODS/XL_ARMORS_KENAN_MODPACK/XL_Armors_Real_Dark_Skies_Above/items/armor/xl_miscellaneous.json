    "description": "<color_white>The Coolest Watch You've NEVER SEEN</color>\u2122\n\nThis is undoubtedly the coolest looking watch you've ever seen before.  Its like something from a sci-fi TV show or a video game.  Its bands are a rich crimson-red leather on the outside and soft sheepskin on the inside, with a sturdy gold clasp on the end of one band and seven beautifully punctured holes at precise intervals on the other band.  Its body is a uniform  black disk with a nearly invisible compartment in the back for batteries.  Its glass faceplate functions as a button which calls forth the most user-friendly interface you've ever used describing all of its numerous functions all conveyed by an silly animated Magic-8 Ball that's saying <color_light_green>'No internet signal found.  Note: Lambda Protocol is active.  Go Team Zenture!'</color>  This can be worn regardless of your state of mutation"
