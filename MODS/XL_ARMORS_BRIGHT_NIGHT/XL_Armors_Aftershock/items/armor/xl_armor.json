    "description": "A sleek, unfathomably-complicated machine covered in dozens of blinking lights, worn on the back by sturdy faux-leather straps.  An electrode dangles from the back, attaching to your forehead.  How it operates without annihilating spacetime isn't quite clear, but a localized portal allows things to be stored in an extradimensional space.  This can be worn regardless of your state of mutation"
