I tried to make a modular mod, so you can delete any folder in Sudo_Requiem with content you don't want.
For now:
- **Late_Game_Items** contains late game craftable items, that have high skill requirement, and sometimes require rare materials. 
  - Non of them are actual armors, because I think vanilla and other mods cover this part well enough already
  - No those are things like bulletproof/fireproof canteen, backpacks and leg rig, the kind of items that keep getting destroyed even when you have the knowledge and ressources to create something more sturdy
  - It also adds one very late game craftable item, which should be only possible to craft in a very long playthrough. This item is supposed to be the best backpack you could hope for, using alien technology.
    - It later occured to me that XEDRA already made an item with a similar reference, well this is the pimped version 
- **QOL**
  - Those are Quality Of Life items, for now just reversible craftable big bundle of materials
    - eg: Big bundle of leather -> needs 50 leather patch + 1 short string -> you can disassemble it to get **all** the items back  
    - This should help hoarders to reduce the hundreds of accumulated basic materials to a few ones, so they take less space and can be moved more easily
    - This should also help reduce lag
